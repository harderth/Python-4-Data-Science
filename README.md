# Einsendeaufgabe - Python 4 Data Science Excercise

## Exercise 1
Regarding the first Exercise, some work was done with Jupyter Notebook. It was set up in **VSCode** and as a backup on **Google Colab** in case there were any problems. After setup, some operators were tested in the `Calculations.ipynb` file to see how Jupyter Notebook works.

## Exercise 2
The secret code now follows as proof of the successful completion of task 2!

`secretKey = "I read the first X (X>=25) exersises"`

# Exercise 3
The tasks for task 3 were solved in the Countries.ipynb file.
